# AdSense Knowledge Base — Index

This directory is the **project-supplied AdSense policy reference** for Fix The Speaker.

It is the authoritative source that any AI agent or developer MUST read before making AdSense-related decisions, recommendations, or code changes.

---

## Purpose

This knowledge base exists to:

1. Provide a stable, curated snapshot of Google AdSense policies relevant to this site.
2. Prevent agents from hallucinating or inventing Google requirements.
3. Enforce evidence discipline: every finding must be traceable to a file in this directory.
4. Protect the existing site from unnecessary, speculative changes.

## Evidence Discipline Rules

Every AdSense finding or recommendation MUST be labelled with exactly one of:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **EXPLICIT POLICY REQUIREMENT** | The supplied knowledge base file directly states this is required. Quote the source. |
| **POLICY PROHIBITION** | The supplied knowledge base file directly prohibits this. Quote the source. |
| **APPROVAL-RISK INFERENCE** | The knowledge base does not explicitly state this, but the pattern suggests approval risk. State the inference clearly. |
| **GENERAL RECOMMENDATION** | A good-practice suggestion not tied to an explicit policy rule. |

> ⚠️ **Never present an APPROVAL-RISK INFERENCE as an EXPLICIT POLICY REQUIREMENT.**
> If the policy file does not say it, you must not say Google requires it.

## Website Preservation Rules

Fix The Speaker is a **launched, live website**. No change is permitted without a source-supported reason:

- Do NOT rebuild, redesign, or restructure the site without explicit justification.
- Do NOT remove working features.
- Do NOT change URLs unless the URL itself is a documented policy problem.
- Do NOT add filler text, padding content, fake testimonials, fake authors, or fake subscriber counts.
- Do NOT make speculative SEO changes under the guise of AdSense compliance.
- Prefer the **smallest effective fix** for every HIGH or MEDIUM risk item.

---

## Scope Limitation

This knowledge base is a point-in-time snapshot. It does not:

- Guarantee Google AdSense approval.
- Reflect real-time policy changes made by Google after the snapshot date.
- Cover account-level Google decisions or traffic-quality signals that only Google can see.

Any audit conducted using this knowledge base must include a statement to that effect in its final report.
